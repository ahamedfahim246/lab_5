# esp32-flappybird-TTGO

All the credits go to [Ponticelli Domenico for the initial M5 stack game](https://github.com/pcelli85/M5Stack_FlappyBird_game).

Made this repository to adapt it for the TTGO and easy upload the game using PlatformIO.

# Instructions
Downlaod Visual Studio Code, add the PlatformIO plugin and add this directory to the workspace.
Connect the TTGO-Display module and pressing upload will upload the game directly to the module.

Happy Gaming!

P.S. Game is very very hard to play. You might adjust some of the parameters in the source code...
